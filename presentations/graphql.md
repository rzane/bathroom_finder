# Full-stack GraphQL

## I'm a backend developer

* I need to route to my controllers
* I need to sanitize incoming parameters
* I need to serialize my models
* I need to handle errors
* I need to document my API

---

## My job is often difficult because...

* I need to choose/invent a schema for my API, because every API is different.
* I need to assume that my clients want every single piece of information, so I need to optimize the worst-case scenario.
* I need to deal with URL parameters, query parameters, and request bodies.
* I need to behave differently for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

---

## I'm a frontend developer

* I need to fetch data from the server
* I need to cache data from the server
* I need to update my UI when data changes
* I need to do optimistic updates
* I need to handle server-sent events/polling

---

## My job is often difficult because...

* I need to write the same code over and over again, because every API is different.
* I need to build slow apps, because I don't have the control that I need to optimize my fields.
* I need to deal with URL parameters, query parameters, and request bodies.
* I need to behave differently for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

---

## So how do we solve this problem?

* One endpoint
* All post requests
* A DSL for querying
*
